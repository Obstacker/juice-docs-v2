## Terminology

Throughout this Legal Reference section there will some analysis of, description of certain features of the Juicebox protocol on Ethereum.

> The primary purpose of Juicebox DAO ("DAO") helps people confidently run programmable and community funded treasuries from startup to scale, openly on Ethereum. The DAO and its community build and maintain the **Juicebox protocol**, a framework for funding and operating projects ("Member Projects") openly on Ethereum. Its contracts allow communities to deploy an administrative NFT, programmable payment terminals for receiving ("Contributions") and distributing funds ("Payouts"), project tokens ("Project Tokens") for community membership, and funding cycles for time-locked and recurring constraintsâ€”all in powerful, customizable ways.

How you configured your Member Project, including Payouts will affect the legal implications of your project, if any.
