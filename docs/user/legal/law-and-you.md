With the introduction of cryptocurrency and smart contracts, programmable money, the ability to encode rules into the money directly has brought about a new way to fundamentally look at the world in a different way. The idea of something purely electronic of substantial value is not new, source code, music, video are itself valuable but require people, agreements, and banking infrastructure in order to realize the benefit. Juicebox enables a framework familiar to people to apply patterns and rules for the receipt, distribution, and management of cryptocurrency natively. Juicebox is capable of doing so because the users are agreeing to set of rules in which are enforced by the smart contracts or extensions. Social contracts, organizational rules and governance processes no longer first class citizens.
