## Projects and the Project Owner's Duties

After creating a Juicebox project, the following emotions may occur:

-   heightened expectations of the potential,
-   daydreaming of the massive stacks of ETH rolling in,
-   your original idea expands into World Domination,
-   Nyancat releases a new animation with your project logo in frosting,
-   community groundswell blows up Discord, your treasury approaches the stratosphere,
-   what kind of legal, regulatory attention did all this bring?

First, this the normal cycle of emotion, so-called the Hero's Journey, this is called the **Juice**. Its completely normal.

Juicebox projects and their configuration vary wildly, how often their funding cycles occur, how much is paid out, and what is the purpose of the treasury. This is the power of Juicebox.

:::warning
You may not misrepresent the purpose of your treasury. This is a material breach of the Juicebox [terms of use](./Juicebox/tos.md). Juicebox treasuries are transparent funding devices where information asymmetry is enforced by [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) on Ethereum. However, the funds eventually are released from the protocol to the Project Owner. You, as that Project Owner, have a duty to be forthright, truthful, and thoughtful.

Common types of Juicebox projects are:

-   one-time funding to acquire property or service, for-profit or non-profit
-   reoccurring funding to do an activity or service, for-profit or non-profit
-   one-time funding to acquire property or service, as a loan

### TLDR

Based on entirely what you claim[^1] will do with the funds determines the degree of responsibility you have over the collected funds. If you promise the funds will be used for a specific purpose or purposes, then you are acting as the trustee of all the contributions, such that a trust would be a logical device to ensure you follow through. You can not misrepresent the use of proceeds, omit expenditures or otherwise in a roll of a Project Owner.

Once an agreement has been formed between parties, the parties owe each other duties, which breached, either lack of performance or payment, the party is in breach of a specific duty of which there are many, and a civil tort arises for which the injured party may file a claim against the other party for damages.

### Laws, Case Law, Statutes, and Jurisdiction

Common law, also known as case law, is the body of unwritten laws based on legal precedent established by the courts. This is a result of previous civil and criminal litigation brought forth to the courts and a judge or jury renders a decision, this is also called judicial precedent. Statutes are laws which are enacted by legislature, or regulatory law. Generally common law encompasses contract law and the law of torts. Contract law concerns itself with agreements between individuals and organizations. Torts concerns the legal action between individuals arising from disputes. Torts is an act or omission that gives rise to injury to another and the amounts to a civil wrong for which the courts impose liability. Where you are located and what countries you interact with determine what statutes are applicable to you.

Aside from regulatory concerns, generally speaking a concern arises with what duties does a Juicebox Project Manager or Member owe the public when creating a Juicebox and any subsequent promotion. What makes the Juicebox unique is the automatic management based on few configuration lever which manage the issuances of tokens which may provide a utility such as governance as well as the protocol will allow redemption against treasuries. This mechanic while transparent, plain spoken has nuances, and Project Manager may either be uncomfortable or unclear about the ramifications of any Juicebox Member Project operations.

The basic elements required for the agreement to be a legally enforceable contract are: mutual assent, expressed by a valid offer and acceptance; adequate consideration; capacity; and legality. In some states, element of consideration can be satisfied by a valid substitute. In other words, contracts are promises that the law will enforce.

### Contracts in Detail

When two parties reach an agreement, this agreement is a contract. A contract creates a legal obligation between both parties. Both parties in a contract must fulfill their duties as specified in the contract. For instance, one party could be bound to deliver certain goods after receiving payment from the other party. An exchange of value, known as **consideration**, is a requirement for a contract to be legally valid.

**Although courts lend more credence to written contracts, a contract can be either written or verbal. It's also possible for a person to enter into a contract through their actions. Parties can use contracts for the sale of both goods and services.** A valid contract includes three important features:

> **Mutual Assent:** All contracted parties should understand the contract's subject matter and its specific terms.

> **Offer and Acceptance:** One party makes an offer indicating their willingness to enter a contract, and the other party unambiguously accepts the offer.

> **Consideration:** The parties agree to exchange something of value, whether money or performance of an act.

When a contract breach occurs, there are several different remedies that are available to the injured party. The remedies available in contract claims will depend on the nature of the breach, and can be either equitable or legal.

A legal remedy usually involves the party that breached the contract providing monetary restitution for the losses suffered by the other party. Legal remedies can take several different forms:

> Compensatory damages
> Consequential damages
> Liquidated damages

An equitable remedy requires that the breaching party take steps to make up for the breach. Equitable remedies can include canceling the contract, known as rescission, or reforming the contract. Both contract claims and remedies can be very complicated because it can be difficult to determine the actual harm caused by a contract breach. For a contract breach to exist, there must be four crucial elements:

_ Formation of a contract.
_ The contract includes enforceable performance terms.
_ One party does not perform their contractual obligations.
_ The failure to perform injures the other party.

### Fiduciary Duty

A legal duty is an obligation, created by law or contract. A legal duty requires a person to conform their actions to a particular standard. And it also carries with it a recognition that the law will enforce this duty to the benefit of other individuals to whom this duty is owed. Put another way, the existence of a legal duty depends on whether the interest that a defendant has allegedly invaded is entitled to legal protection. For example, in the context of tort law, a landowner may have a legal duty to protect invitees from hazards on their property, like an open pit.[^2] In this case, if his guest were to be injured, the landowner would have breached his duty.

There exists a number of duties, according to Wikipedia[^3], care, candour, defend, to settle, rescue, retreat, report a felony, vote, warn, fiduciary, special formed upon contract, in loco parentis (like a parent to a child to nonhuman entities).

### For-profit, Non-profit, Incorporated, Unincorporated, DAOs

In simplest terms, a business entity is an organization created by an individual or individuals to conduct business, engage in a trade or partake in similar activities. There are various types of business entities — sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC, corporation, etc. — and a business's entity type dictates both the structure of that organization and how that company is taxed.

When starting a business, one of the first things you want to do is choose the structure of your company — in other words, choose a business entity type.[^5]

Generally when establishing an entity, you register in the state where your business is located. The entity is organized between individuals by agreement, written or oral, or by performance. Therefore in addition to contract and tort law considerations, most entity structures are codified by the state in which they are located. Given organizations are themselves entities, the operation and governance is usually codified.

Corporate law is the practice of law in which the shareholders, directors and officers and their relationships, rights both statutory and common, contract, and duties defined. The existence of an association of individuals operating as an unincorporated organization is so common a modal act exists for states to expand upon. Whether or not a state has specific statutes recognizing a DAO, the activities of the individuals are instructive. The following discussions use the term association, but this is interchangeable with Juicebox Treasury Owner.

As highlighted above generally there are several factors of the association which determine what structure and duties are reasonable.

-   Representations made by the association to the public
-   What is the purpose of the association, and finally,
-   Do the participants (project owner, members, contributors) have an expectation of profit?
