## Introductions

When considering creating a Juicebox treasury, there are a number of legal considerations. Juicebox can be configured to operate a non-profit, for-profit, one-time or reoccurring fund raise, however when to consider IRL ramifications of a new project, from which legal jurisdiction to operate in to the legal structure of the project a number of factors maybe considered.  Before presenting options of such devices, background on some legal concepts maybe helpful.

### Laws, Case Law, Statutes, and Jurisdiction

Common law, also known as Case Law, is the body of unwritten laws based on legal precedent established by the courts.  This is a result of previous civil and criminal litigation bringing forth matters to a court and a judge or jury renders a decision, this is also called judicial precedent. Statutes are laws which are enacted by legislature, or regulatory law. Generally common law encompasses contract law and the law of torts. Contract law concerns itself with agreements between individuals and organizations. Torts concerns the legal action between individuals arising from disputes. Torts is an act or omission that gives rise to injury to another and the amounts to a civil wrong for which the courts impose liability. 

Contracts are agreements between individuals or entities (organization, corporation, partnership) or generally parties, where one party makes and offer and other party accepts it. This agreement does not need to be in writing.
