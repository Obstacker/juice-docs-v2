#### Purpose.

The primary purpose of the DAO is to build and create Ethereum based tools for member projects ("Member Project") to operate transparent treasuries based on the Juicebox protocol. The Member Project's transparent treasury receives cryptocurrency and cryptographically secured tokens (ERC-20 and ERC-721) ("Contributions"), and may issue Member Project tokens ("Project Tokens"). The accounting between Contributions received and Project Tokens issued is controlled by the Member Project configurations of the treasury properties. The following configurations are available:

-   Funding Cycle automation and duration. The duration of time the configuration of the Member Project is active.
-   Payouts. The fixed amount or percentage of cryptocurrency to distribute for each Funding Cycle per address.
-   Project Token Issuance, also referred to as initial mint rate of Member Project Token. Valid values are between 1,000,000 and 1
-   Reserved Tokens. The percentage of total Project Tokens withheld from distribution for the Contribution. Valid values are between 0 and 100.
-   Reserved Token allocation. The individual, entities which will receive Project Token from the Reserved Tokens allocation.
-   Discount Rate. The percentage which the Token issuance will decrease each funding cycle. Valid values are between 0 and 20.
-   Redemption Rate. The amount of overflow each Project Token may be redeemed for.
-   Pause payments. When enabled, Member Projects cannot receive payments.
-   Allow token minting. When enabled, Project Tokens can be issued at will.
-   Reconfiguration rules, or Ballot. Conditions which must be met for a project to be reconfigured.

Additionally, JBDAO requires enabling payment processing beyond cryptocurrency, treasury holdings to include stable coins, tooling for the creation, deployment and presentation of tokens including ERC-721, and other activities to support the ecosystem of Member Projects and protocols including Juicebox.

The DAO shall have the power to do any and all acts appropriate, convenient, desirable, incidental, or necessary to or in furtherance of the purposes described in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any and all of the powers that may be exercised on behalf of the DAO by its members. The DAO shall not engage in profit-making activities. Any profits that are incidentally accrued or earned from any of the DAO's activities will be used or set aside for the DAO's nonprofit purposes.
